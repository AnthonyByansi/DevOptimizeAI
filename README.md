# Getting Started with Developer Assist Dashboard

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

Developer Assist Dashboard shows you how to build a tab with Azure DevOps work items, GitHub issues and Planner tasks to accelerate developer team collaboration and productivity. Developer Assist Dashboard is capable of working on Microsoft Teams, Outlook Web and Microsoft 365 app.
